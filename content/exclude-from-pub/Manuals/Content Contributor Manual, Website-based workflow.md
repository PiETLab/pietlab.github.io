# Content Contributor Manual, Website-based workflow
Lab website: https://pietlab.github.io/
### 1. Introduction to Your Role
Welcome aboard! As a secondary content producer, your role is to help keep our lab’s website up-to-date and accurate. You’ll be making edits to the website’s content directly through GitHub, using a branch that we’ll set up for you. Think of yourself as the editor who steps in to revise or add new information, ensuring everything is polished and ready to go.
You won’t need to worry about the technical side of things like creating branches or setting up the site. We’ll handle that part for you. Your focus will be on making content changes and then submitting those changes for review. Once your updates are approved, they’ll be published to the main site.
In the following sections, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know step-by-step, so you’ll be all set to dive in.
### 2. Understanding the Lab Website and GitHub Pages Setup
Our lab website is generated using GitHub Pages. All website content lives in a GitHub repository in Markdown format. When changes are made to those Markdown files and merged into the main branch, GitHub Pages automatically regenerates the site and publishes the updates.
As a contributor, you will make edits within a separate branch that we create for you. Once your edits are reviewed and approved, they are merged into the main branch, and the site will update to reflect your changes.
### 3. Setting Up Your GitHub Account and Access
If you don’t already have a GitHub account:
1. Visit [https://github.com](https://github.com) and sign up.
2. Share your GitHub username with the site maintainer.
3. You will receive an email invitation to join the repository. Accept the invitation to gain access.
You do not need to install Git or use the command line. All your work can be done through the web interface.
### 4. Navigating to Your Assigned Branch
Once added to the repository:
1. Navigate to the repo URL. https://github.com/PiETLab/pietlab-site-private
2. Use the branch dropdown (top-left) to switch to your assigned branch (e.g., `jessica-content`).
3. All your edits should be made in this branch.
### 5. Editing Markdown Files in GitHub’s Web Interface
To edit a Markdown file:
1. Navigate to the file you want to edit.
2. Click the pencil icon in the top right of the file view.
3. Make your changes.
4. Scroll down and enter a short description of your edits in the “Commit changes” box.
5. Choose “Commit directly to the {your-branch-name} branch.”
6. Click the green “Commit changes” button.
You can also create new Markdown files by clicking the “Add file” > “Create new file” button.
### 6. Submitting a Pull Request for Review
Once you have made your changes:
1. Go to the “Pull requests” tab.
2. Click “New pull request.”
3. Set the base branch to main and the compare branch to your assigned branch.
4. Review the differences.
5. Add a title and optional description.
6. Click “Create pull request.”
The maintainer will be notified and will review your changes.
### 7. The Review and Merge Workflow
After you submit a pull request:
- The maintainer may leave comments or request revisions.
- You can make edits in your branch and the pull request will update automatically.
- Once everything looks good, the maintainer will merge your pull request.
- Your content will go live shortly after.
### 8. Syncing Your Branch After Merges
After your pull request is merged:
1. Go to your branch in the GitHub web interface.
2. If your branch is now behind main, GitHub will show a “Compare & pull request” button.
3. Use it to sync your branch with the latest changes from main.
This helps ensure that your future edits are based on the most up-to-date version.
### 9. Additional Tips and Troubleshooting
- Keep commit messages clear and descriptive.
- Use Preview mode to verify your Markdown formatting.
- If you need help, open an “Issue” and tag the maintainer using @{maintainer-username}.
- Never edit files in the main branch directly.
- Always ensure your changes are saved before navigating away.
